# Daily UI 002

Design a credit card checkout form or page. Don't forget the important elements such as the numbers, dates, security numbers, etc.

## Informations

Made with HTML, CSS and React.js.\
Initial code made by `Create React App`.\
For the sake of the demonstration, store and database are represented by simple mocks, but can easily be replaced with real API calls and/or libraries.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
